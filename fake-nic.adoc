= Fake NIC create

The `fake-nic.sh` script for creating the (additional) HostID if your laptop don't have any wired Ethernet Adapter or many other cases :)


== Usage

. Customize variable  `$DEV` and `$MAC` in `fake-nic.sh`
. Run it as `root`-user:
+
```
./fake-nic.sh
```
+
that install required dependencies on your system and add NIC with proper `$DEV` (name) and `$MAC` (hostid)

=== Run on every bootup

The quick and dirty way to bring up fake NIC on every bootup is adding to your `/etc/rc.local` strings like this:
```
  MAC="E4:7D:DE:AD:BE:EF"
  DEV="eth1"
  ip tuntap add ${DEV} mode tap
  ifconfig ${DEV} hw ether ${MAC}
  ifconfig ${DEV} up
```


== Limitation

This script works only on OS RHEL/CentOS 6.x/7.x as well. OS checker is built-in.


== Explanation of working

see the source code link:fake-nic.sh[]

== ToDo

* DEV and MAC pass as argv
* Create a systemd script executing for network activation
